  <p>
  This seccion is about <a href="http://jpgraph.net/" alt="JPGRAPH" title="JPGRAPH"  class="linkdemo">JPGRAPH</a>.The JpGraph library is a 2D graph plotting library for PHP4 and PHP5.<br/><br/>
  I learnt to use this library in ZED WORLDWIDE, developing a CRM tool for mobile companies.<br/>
  Trought various examples I want to show how to implement the most common graphs I used.<br/><br/>
  Datas could be retrieved from a database, from a plain text file or from some WEB-services adn sucessively stored into a Php array to be drawn in the graphs.<br/>
  The graphs are  images generated dynamically when a user is viewing a particular WEB-page.
