  <b>Bachelor degree :</b>
  <p>Bachelor degree on <b>digital communication</b> is something between computer engineering and graphic arts. A digital communicator is a <b>front-end web developer</b>, that is: a <b>WEB DESIGNER</b>.</p>
  <p>During my studies I had the possibility to choose between three different especializations: videogames, multimedia or mobile. I choosed the first one and completed my training with an extra 8 exams dedicated to web technologies:</p>

  <b>The Erasmus grant:</b>
  <p>During the academic year 03-04 I was part of the Erasmus program with the BTU (Brandeburgische Technische Universität) of <b>Cottbus (Germany)</b>.
  The goal of the six months period was going deep on my knowledge on <b>3D graphic</b> programs: <b>Maya</b> and <b>Cinema4D</b>.</p>
 <b>The bachelor thesis:</b><br />
 <p>The project was called “<b>Animation and interaction in a 3D world on the web</b>”, and consists in: creating a <b>plug-in for Maya</b> (called MAYATOXVR) able to export all the information of the 3D scene; developing an interface to manage the plug-in inside Maya; and implementing an interactive demo.<br /> 
  To develop the project I used different technologies: C++ y Maya API (for the plug-in), MEL language (for the interface), the XVR editor and C++ (for interactivity through web with the 3D exported models), HTML and javascript.</p>
  <b>Future training:</b><br />
  <p>As soon as possible: Java for Android</p>
